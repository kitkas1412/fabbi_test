## 1. Disclosure statement

AI-assisted tools are being used during this assessment for repository analysis, risk prioritization, planning, and documentation scaffolding. Generated suggestions are treated as drafts until reviewed against the repository, README requirements, tests, and runtime behavior. The candidate remains responsible for every submitted change and decision.

## 2. Tools used

| Tool/model | Purpose | Access level | Data shared | Human verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OpenAI Codex | Repository review, security/correctness analysis, assessment planning, and Markdown drafting | Read/write access to the assessment workspace | Repository source, configuration, Git metadata, and user-provided prompts; no production data or credentials | Compared with `README.md`, source code, Git state, and local static checks; candidate review remains required |

## 4. Material decisions influenced by AI

| Decision | AI contribution | Candidate decision and rationale | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prioritize authorization, cache isolation, and JWT before feature work | Identified these as the highest-risk confidentiality/integrity failures | Adopted; regression coverage and fixes were implemented before optional features | Commits `cea96fd` through `b35b042`; fast backend suite now passes 34/34 |
| Target the maximum 115/100 score | Mapped 100 mandatory points plus 15 Tier 4 bonus points | Adopted for planning; mandatory gates must pass before bonus work | README traceability matrix |
| Keep Todo Sharing as specification-only work | Flagged README's explicit instruction not to implement Task 3A | Adopted to prevent scope expansion | `docs/TODO_SHARING_SPEC.md` |
| Track assessment documents while keeping the answer key ignored | Identified the conflict between required `docs/` deliverables and the root ignore rule | Adopted; removed broad `docs/` ignore and retained `docs/ANSWER_KEY.md` | `git check-ignore` verification |
| Keep backend dependencies managed by `requirements.txt` | Identified that the three-line `uv.lock` was generated incidentally, targeted Python 3.13, and was not used by Docker or setup instructions | Adopted; removed the lockfile in standalone commit `23b039e` and used `uv --no-project` only as an isolated test runner | Docker targets Python 3.12; Black targets `py312`; full backend rerun passes on Python 3.12.12 |
| Keep data services internal by default | Recommended removing PostgreSQL/Redis host publications instead of merely binding them to localhost, while preserving administration through `docker compose exec` | Adopted; host-run backend development must use separate local services or an explicit override | `docker compose ps` shows only container ports; GUIDE documents the operational tradeoff |

Add source code and test files to this table when AI materially contributes to them.

## 6. Rejected suggestions and corrections

| Suggestion | Why rejected or changed | Final approach |
|---|---|---|
| Treat unfamiliar Python package names as evidence of malware | Package names alone were insufficient, and official package metadata showed the dependency chain | Do not classify them as malicious; still reduce unused production dependencies later |
| Install missing dependencies immediately during the read-only audit | Installation was not required to identify the initial environment blocker and would mutate the workspace | Record the blocker first; install through the approved project setup in the baseline phase |
| Implement Todo Sharing while addressing the assessment | README explicitly states Task 3A is specification-only | Produce the specification without implementation unless separately requested |

## 7. Verification performed by the candidate

- [ ] Reviewed every changed line and related call path.
- [ ] Confirmed behavior against `README.md` and API contracts.
- [x] Ran relevant backend tests.
- [x] Ran relevant frontend lint/build/tests.
- [x] Ran PostgreSQL/Redis integration checks where mocks are insufficient.
- [x] Reviewed migrations and rollback behavior.
- [x] Validated Docker/runtime configuration.
- [x] Removed tracked environment files and verified no real secrets, personal data, or private context were added.
- [ ] Recorded checks that could not be run and why.

## 8. Limitations

- AI output can be incomplete or incorrect and is not treated as test evidence.
- Suggested security controls require threat-model and integration review.
- Suggested database indexes require measured PostgreSQL evidence; the current benchmark supplies PostgreSQL evidence but remains local, warm-cache, and workload-specific.
- Fixed auth, ownership, partial-update, cache, and frontend-session findings have automated regression evidence. A forced component-level optimistic-mutation failure and selected exploratory manual cases remain useful additional coverage.
- The first backend test attempt was blocked because the system Python environment lacked `pytest`; later isolated and non-root container runs pass, with the current fast suite at 38/38.
- Backend fast tests use SQLite and a stateful Redis mock; separate PostgreSQL/Redis integration and refresh-concurrency evidence pass 2/2. Redis-outage behavior is not exercised.
- Both required Playwright journeys pass; same-context account-switch cache behavior still has unit coverage only.
- Candidate review, identity spelling confirmation, and final attestation are pending.

## 9. Final attestation
