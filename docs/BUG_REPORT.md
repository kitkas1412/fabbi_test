| Overall status | Historical remediation findings through `CACHE-004` are verified. The Tier 4 Tag database foundation is implemented and verified in the current worktree; Tag APIs, filtering, and bulk actions are not part of this change. Manual exploratory cases and final PR review remain separate submission activities. |

## Purpose

This document is the source of truth for defects discovered during the assessment. Every finding must include a reproducible impact, a root cause, a scoped fix, and verification evidence. Update the status and evidence links in the same pull request that changes the behavior.

## Status definitions

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Open | Confirmed and not yet being fixed |
| In Progress | Implementation or verification is in progress |
| Fixed | Code change is complete but final evidence is pending |
| Verified | Regression and relevant integration tests pass |
| Deferred | Intentionally postponed with owner, reason, and risk acceptance |
| Rejected | Not reproducible or not a defect; include evidence |

No Critical or High issue may remain Deferred for final submission.

| API-001 | Resource control | Todo page size has no upper bound | Medium | `backend/app/api/v1/todos.py::list_todos` | Verified | `729f1e8` | `test_todo_list_rejects_page_size_above_maximum` confirms `size=101` returns 422; backend cap and frontend default are both 100; fast Docker suite subsequently passes 38/38 |
| FE-001 | Data isolation | Todo React Query key omits user and pagination context | High | `frontend/src/features/todos/api/todos.ts` | Verified | `d5fa690` | Node regression confirms keys differ by user, page, and size; lint/build and the final 9/9 frontend unit suite pass |
| FE-002 | Session | Logout/account change does not clear user-scoped query data | High | Auth hooks and query client | Verified | `d5fa690` | Unit regression confirms token/query cleanup; Journey 1 confirms browser logout cleanup and Journey 2 confirms isolated sessions; same-context account switching remains unit-only |
| FE-003 | State | Optimistic update does not restore the snapshot on error | Medium | `frontend/src/features/todos/api/todos.ts` | Fixed | `d5fa690` | User-scoped snapshots are restored in `onError`; lint/build pass. A component-level forced-mutation-failure test is still a useful future strengthening. |
| FE-004 | Authentication | Global 401 handling reloads login and can hide form errors | Medium | `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` | Fixed | `773a960` | Node regression proves `/auth/login` 401 stays local to the form while protected-request 401 clears the session; unit tests, lint, and build pass |
| FE-005 | Pagination | Frontend requests 10,000 Todos by default | Medium | `frontend/src/features/todos/api/todos.ts::useTodos` | Fixed | `4a3f7fb` | Default page size is an explicit 100, matching the backend maximum; Node regression, lint, and build pass |
| FE-006 | React | Todo rows use array indexes as keys | Low | `frontend/src/features/todos/components/TodoList.tsx` | Verified | `b688c66` | Todo rows use stable Todo IDs; Node regression, lint, and build pass |
| INFRA-001 | Startup | Compose has no dependency healthchecks/readiness conditions | High | `docker-compose.yml` | Verified | `de88674` | Cold start with `docker compose up -d --build --wait` gates backend on healthy PostgreSQL/Redis and frontend on healthy backend; all four services become healthy |
| INFRA-002 | Secrets | Development credentials are embedded in tracked configuration | High | Compose, settings, tracked `.env` files | Verified | `de88674` | Tracked `.env` files removed; Compose requires database, Redis, and JWT values from ignored local environment configuration |
| INFRA-003 | Network | PostgreSQL and unauthenticated Redis are published to the host | High | `docker-compose.yml` | Verified | `de88674` | `docker compose ps` shows only internal `5432/tcp` and `6379/tcp`; unauthenticated `redis-cli ping` returns `NOAUTH` |
| INFRA-004 | Containers | Images run as root and lack scoped `.dockerignore` files | Medium | Backend/frontend Dockerfiles | Verified | `de88674` | Backend runs as `uid=999(app)`, frontend as `uid=1000(node)`; scoped ignore files reduce contexts to application inputs and exclude nested caches |
| INFRA-005 | Build | Frontend build is not reproducible and runtime Vite env is ineffective | Medium | Frontend Dockerfile and Compose | Verified | `de88674` | Image build uses `npm ci`; `VITE_API_URL` is supplied as a build argument; production image build passes |
| TEST-001 | Coverage | Existing tests cover happy paths but not security boundaries | High | `backend/tests/` | Verified | `cea96fd`, `5816658`, `576e7c6`–current | Suite covers expiry, token type, refresh rotation/revocation, login enumeration, password validation, database email/tag uniqueness, cross-user CRUD, cache isolation/invalidation/commit ordering/outage handling, Todo-to-Tag mapping integrity, eager Todo users, bounded pagination, partial updates, required secrets, stable ordering, settings, and CORS configuration; 44/44 pass |
| TEST-002 | Fidelity | SQLite and per-request Redis mocks do not validate production behavior | Medium | `backend/integration_tests/` | Verified | `6a68c70` | Dedicated Compose suite passes 2/2 against PostgreSQL 16 and authenticated Redis 7: direct user-scoped cache namespaces/invalidation plus atomic concurrent refresh rotation |
| TEST-003 | Test maintenance | Custom async event-loop fixture is deprecated and will become an error | Low | `backend/tests/`, `backend/pytest.ini` | Verified | `3326159` | Tests declare session loop scope with pytest-asyncio and a warning filter makes reintroducing the deprecated custom fixture fail; fast suite 38/38 has no pytest-asyncio event-loop warning |
| CONFIG-001 | Backend compatibility | Pydantic class-based `Config` is deprecated before Pydantic v3 | Low | `backend/app/core/config.py` | Verified | `dd80d33` | `SettingsConfigDict` preserves the environment-file and case-sensitive contract; configuration regression plus backend tests, Black, and Flake8 pass without the Pydantic warning |
| CONFIG-002 | Security | CORS permits any origin and SQL echo logs queries by default | High | `backend/app/main.py`, `backend/app/core/config.py` | Verified | `2d8bcff` | Credentialed CORS now uses configured non-wildcard origins; `DB_ECHO` defaults to `false`. Regressions cover allowed/rejected origins, CORS validation, and the logging default. |
| DEP-001 | Frontend security | Production dependency tree contains 6 known vulnerabilities | High | `frontend/package.json`, `frontend/package-lock.json` | Verified | `15426ca` | Axios floor raised to 1.20.0, React Router DOM floor to 7.18.4, and compatible transitive fixes are locked; `npm audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities |
| DEP-002 | Backend compatibility | Passlib/bcrypt stack emits an internal version lookup error during password hashing | Medium | `backend/requirements.txt`, `backend/app/core/security.py` | Verified | `fecd7e0` | Removed unmaintained Passlib and call bcrypt directly; current `$2b$` hashes remain valid. Registration/login reject passwords over bcrypt's 72 UTF-8-byte limit before hashing, and the backend suite has no Passlib/`crypt` warning. |
| QUALITY-001 | Backend quality | Required backend Black and Flake8 gates failed | Low | `backend/tests/conftest.py` | Verified | `24bba4d` | The five intentionally delayed imports document the database bootstrap requirement and use scoped `# noqa: E402`; `black --check .` and unfiltered `flake8 app tests` pass |
| FE-007 | Frontend performance | Production JavaScript bundle exceeds Vite's 500 kB warning threshold | Medium | `frontend/src/router/index.tsx` | Verified | `9b5c9f6` | Login, registration, and Todo dashboard pages load per route via `React.lazy`; the production build no longer emits Vite's 500 kB chunk warning. |
| FE-008 | Accessibility | Todo dialogs omit an accessible description | Low | `frontend/src/features/todos/components/TodoForm.tsx` | Verified | `b4242a0` | Create and edit Todo dialogs now render a contextual `DialogDescription`, associating the form purpose with the dialog for screen readers; Playwright no longer logs Radix's missing-description warning. |
| FE-009 | Error handling | Structured registration validation errors can crash React toast rendering | Medium | `frontend/src/lib/apiError.ts`, `frontend/src/features/auth/components/` | Verified | `60c4a67` | Axios error details are normalized to a non-empty string before reaching Sonner. FastAPI 422 arrays expose their first validation `msg`; unknown payloads use a safe form-specific fallback. |
| FE-010 | Build compatibility | Vite config uses `__dirname`, unsupported by the planned native config loader | Low | `frontend/vite.config.ts` | Verified | `259ab7f` | The alias now resolves from `import.meta.dirname`; Vite's production build succeeds without the planned-native-loader warning. |
| FE-011 | Runtime deployment | A stale frontend bundle requests an unsupported Todo page size | High | Running `frontend` image; `frontend/src/features/todos/api/queryKeys.ts` | Verified | `85346dc` | Rebuilt/recreated frontend image and Playwright Journey 1 against `http://localhost:3000` verifies the initial Todo request returns `200` with `size=100`. |
| DOC-001 | Deliverables | `docs/` was ignored despite required assessment documents | Medium | `.gitignore` | Verified | `3d1936b` | Deliverables are tracked while `docs/ANSWER_KEY.md` remains ignored |

Add newly discovered issues before implementing their fixes. Do not silently omit a finding because it falls outside the minimum five fixes required by Tier 1.

### AUTH-006 — Authentication accepts passwords shorter than the UI contract

- **Status:** Verified
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Category:** Validation / Authentication
- **Location:** `backend/app/schemas/user.py::UserCreate`,
  `backend/app/schemas/user.py::UserLogin`, and `backend/app/api/v1/auth.py::login`.
- **Observed behavior:** The backend only rejected passwords above bcrypt's
  72-byte limit. Empty and short values reached registration or login even though
  the frontend requires at least 6 characters.
- **Expected behavior:** Registration and login reject passwords shorter than 6
  characters with `422`; both layers also reject passwords exceeding 72 UTF-8
  bytes before bcrypt is called.
- **Fix applied:** Added Pydantic `min_length=6` to both authentication request
  schemas, changed the login route to use `UserLogin`, and reused a Zod password
  schema that enforces both the character minimum and byte maximum.
- **Regression test:** Backend parameterized API test covers empty and 5-character
  passwords for `/auth/register` and `/auth/login`. Frontend unit test covers a
  valid 6-character password and UTF-8 boundaries (18 vs. 19 emoji).
- **Verification:** Backend Docker suite 40/40, Black, and Flake8 pass;
  frontend unit suite 10/10, ESLint, and production build pass.
- **PR/commit:** `3d7029d`.

### CACHE-004 — Redis invalidation failure turns a committed Todo mutation into 500

- **Status:** Verified (current worktree; commit pending)
- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** Availability / Consistency
- **Location:** `backend/app/api/v1/todos.py::commit_todo_mutation`.
- **Observed behavior:** The helper committed the database transaction, then
  awaited Redis invalidation without handling Redis errors. A Redis outage could
  therefore return `500` after a Todo was already written, encouraging the
  client to retry and create a duplicate.
- **Expected behavior:** A database commit remains successful when cache
  invalidation is unavailable. The cache failure is observable, while DB commit
  failures still roll back and fail the request.
- **Fix applied:** Redis `RedisError` during Todo-list version invalidation is
  handled as best effort only after a successful commit. The application logs
  the `todo_cache_invalidation_failed` event with the affected user ID and a
  traceback for alerting.
- **Compatibility/tradeoffs:** This prioritizes write availability and avoids
  duplicate retries. If Redis recovers with an old list entry, that entry can
  remain stale for its five-minute TTL. A durable outbox or idempotency key is
  the next step if immediate invalidation or retry-safe write deduplication is
  required.
- **Regression test:** `test_create_todo_succeeds_when_cache_invalidation_is_unavailable`
  makes Redis `incr` fail, then verifies `201`, DB-visible data, and the warning
  event.
- **Verification:** Backend Docker suite 41/41, Black, and Flake8 pass.
- **PR/commit:** Current worktree; commit pending.

### CONFIG-002 — Credentialed CORS is open and SQL logging defaults to on

- **Status:** Verified
- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** Configuration / Data exposure
- **Location:** `backend/app/main.py::CORSMiddleware` and
  `backend/app/core/config.py::Settings`.
- **Observed behavior:** CORS used `allow_origins=["*"]` while credentials were
  enabled, and SQLAlchemy echo was on by default. Any browser origin could make
  requests, and application logs could include query values such as email
  addresses.
- **Fix applied:** Added comma-separated `CORS_ORIGINS` configuration with
  normalization and wildcard rejection. The middleware accepts only that
  allowlist and required API methods/headers. `DB_ECHO` now defaults to `false`;
  Compose and `.env.example` expose both settings explicitly.
- **Regression test:** Configuration tests cover default values, multi-origin
  parsing, and wildcard rejection. API regression verifies the local frontend
  origin receives CORS headers while an untrusted origin does not.
- **Verification:** Backend Docker suite 40/40, Black, and Flake8 pass.
- **PR/commit:** `2d8bcff`.

### FE-011 — Stale frontend image requests an invalid Todo page size

- **Status:** Verified
- **Severity:** High
- **Category:** Deployment / Availability
- **Location:** The running Compose `frontend` image; current source default is
  `frontend/src/features/todos/api/queryKeys.ts::DEFAULT_TODO_PAGE_SIZE`.
- **Requirement:** The frontend default must respect the backend
  `GET /api/v1/todos` limit of `1..100`.
- **Observed behavior:** After a successful login, the browser displays
  “Failed to load todos. Please try again.” The backend log records
  `GET /api/v1/todos?page=1&size=10000` followed by `422 Unprocessable Entity`.
- **Expected behavior:** The browser requests `size=100` (the current frontend
  default and backend maximum) and renders the Todo list or the empty state.
- **Impact:** A logged-in user cannot load Todos. The generic UI error hides the
  actionable server validation reason.
- **Reproduction:**
  1. Start the currently cached Compose frontend image and open
     `http://localhost:3000`.
  2. Log in with a valid account.
  3. Observe the Todo error UI and the backend request with `size=10000`.
  4. Compare with current source, where `DEFAULT_TODO_PAGE_SIZE` is `100`, or
     call the API with the same token and `size=100` to receive `200`.
- **Root cause:** The running frontend image was created at
  `2026-09-18T07:56:24Z`, before the bounded-page-size change, then restarted
  without rebuilding. It serves an obsolete Vite bundle while the backend is
  current and correctly rejects the old request contract.
- **Fix applied:** Rebuilt and recreated the frontend from the current commit:
  `docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate frontend`. Journey 1 now
  asserts the first browser Todo-list request has `size=100` and receives `200`,
  providing a served-application guard against this contract drift.
- **Compatibility/tradeoffs:** Rebuilding the static frontend is safe and does
  not alter data. It briefly restarts only the frontend service; active browser
  sessions need a refresh.
- **Regression test:** `frontend/e2e/todo-lifecycle.spec.ts` waits for the
  initial Todo-list response, requires `200`, and asserts `size=100`. The
  existing `frontend/tests/cache-isolation.test.ts` retains the source-level
  default check.
- **Integration/manual evidence:** `2026-09-19` local runtime: valid login and
  `GET /todos?page=1&size=100` return `200`; the stale bundle's request with
  `size=10000` returns `422`. After the targeted image rebuild, Playwright
  Journey 1 against Docker frontend passes 1/1 and verifies `size=100`.
- **PR/commit:** `85346dc`.

| Migration upgrade/downgrade | `alembic upgrade head`; `alembic current` against PostgreSQL | Pass | Upgrade/current pass at `c3d5e7f9a1b2 (head)`; performance index downgrade/re-upgrade also passed | `2026-09-18` | Email-uniqueness migration preflights duplicate data; concurrent-index rollback evidence is in `docs/PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md` |
| Container hardening | `docker compose exec -T {backend,frontend} id`; `docker compose ps`; Redis auth probes | Non-root; authenticated data services not host-published | Pass: app UIDs are 999/1000; DB/cache expose no host bindings; unauthenticated Redis returns `NOAUTH` and authenticated ping succeeds | `2026-09-18` | `INFRA-002`–`INFRA-005` verified |
| Performance benchmark | See `docs/PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md` | PostgreSQL evidence, migration, plans, timings, tradeoffs | Pass: 10k users/1M Todos; Q1 median 22.245→0.056 ms and Q2 20.471→0.064 ms; index is 56 MB; concurrent upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade pass | `2026-09-18` | `DB-002`, `DB-004`; no SQLite evidence used |

## Residual risks and accepted limitations

| Risk | Severity | Reason not fixed | Mitigation | Owner | Review date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Redis invalidation is best effort, not durable | Medium | A Redis `incr` outage no longer fails a committed Todo mutation, but an old cached list can remain stale for its five-minute TTL after Redis recovers | Alert on `todo_cache_invalidation_failed`; add an outbox or idempotency key if immediate invalidation or write deduplication is required | Nguyen Dinh Duc | `2026-09-19` |
